Easily send email from your WordPress site through Mailgun using the HTTP API or SMTP.

== Description ==

[Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/) is the email automation engine trusted by over 10,000 website and application developers for sending, receiving and tracking emails. By taking advantage of Mailgun's powerful email APIs, developers can spend more time building awesome websites and less time fighting with email servers. Mailgun supports all of the most popular languages including PHP, Ruby, Python, C# and Java.

One particularly useful feature of this plugin is that it provides you with a way to send email when the server you are on does not support SMTP or where outbound SMTP is restricted since the plug-in uses the Mailgun HTTP API for sending email by default. All you need to use the plugin is a [Mailgun account](http://www.mailgun.com/). Mailgun has a free account that lets you send up to 200 emails per day, which is great for testing. Paid subscriptions are available for increased limits.

The current version of this plugin only handles sending emails. Future releases will include additional functionality around processing incoming emails, tracking and analytics. Until then, you can configure how to handle incoming emails and set up analytics in the Mailgun control panel or using the Mailgun API.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `mailgun` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install directly through the plugin installer
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress or by using the link provided by the plugin installer
1. Visit the settings page in the Admin at `Settings -> Mailgun` and configure the plugin with your account details

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
