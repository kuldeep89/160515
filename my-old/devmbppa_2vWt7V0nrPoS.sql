(39, 4, 4, 'How to Convert Social Media Traffic Into Leads', '<p>The ultimate goal of social media in marketing is to generate leads. The problem is that many small businesses approach social media as a form of linear marketing, which is not the correct approach. Linear marketing is marketing that is distributed in its finished form--it''s a one-shot communication like a TV ad, toward which the audience has only one avenue of response.&nbsp;<br><br>Instead, social media is a form of non-linear marketing, meaning that it is an evolving and fluid (even slightly out-of-control) two-way street. You can''t predict how customers will find your business and convert into leads via social media--instead, you need to maximize their opportunities to find you. With this in mind, here''s a step-by-step guide to converting your social media traffic into leads.<br><br></p><ol><li><strong>Build Your Reach </strong>- Social media is worthless if no one is interacting with your business. In order to build your reach, you need to share plenty of links to timely and helpful media and content. The average shelf life of a social media link is three hours, so use automatic sharing software to post often--every three hours is usually too often, but set the sharing software to post every six hours in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Use your existing contacts to find friends on social media, and invite contacts to follow or friend you using whatever email marketing system you already have in place.<br><br></li><li><strong>Maximize Content Discovery </strong>- Depending on your time and resources, you might create and share content once a week, or once a day. Whatever schedule works best for your company, maintain a consistent stream of original content. Then, share it on a regular schedule. Wherever you share the content, be sure to link to it on all your social networks. Most important, create <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/192" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/192"><em>calls-to-action (CTA)</em></a> that offer the content to your followers in exchange for their contact information, and place these CTAs everywhere--in blog posts, emails, on your Facebook timeline, and in tweets.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Create Landing Pages </strong>- The one common factor in all social media marketing is the landing page, which is the page visitors are taken to when they respond to a CTA. The landing page typically has a form with basic contact information that the lead fills out in order to get access to content. This is the primary mechanic of converting leads with social media, and it''s so important that social media without landing pages is rendered almost meaningless to a marketer. For more information of creating landing pages, click here.<br><br></li><li><strong>Test Your Methods </strong>- One of the surest ways to improve your social media lead generation is to carry out radical experiments with your methods. Drastically change the types of content you offer to see what kinds of content generates the greatest number of responses to your CTAs. Modify the design of your CTAs to make them more eye-catching, and experiment with their wording--try to achieve as much impact per word as possible. Although you may think you know what people want, experimentation will often prove that people want something different. In order to analyze the results of these experiments, you need some sort of social media analytics software like HubSpot or Google Analytics. To learn more about testing your methods, read the article about social media analytics.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Optimize Your Conversion Rates and Traffic </strong>- Once you have the results of your experiments, you are able to make the best decision about how to increase conversion rates. For example, if a certain type of content achieves a remarkable conversion rate, offer more that content. As you optimize your conversion rates, you can devote some time to increasing your traffic by publishing more content, especially searchable blog posts and website pages. To learn how to increase traffic resulting from internet searches, also known as Search Engine Optimization, follow the link.&nbsp;<br><br></li></ol><p>After implementing these steps to maximize lead generation with social media, follow the links to learn more about strategies specific to <em><a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/29" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/29">Facebook</a>, <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/127" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/127">Twitter</a>, <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/290" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/290">LinkedIn</a></em>, <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/375" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/375">Google</a>+, <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/320" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/320"><em>Pinterest</em></a>, <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/309" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/309">Instagram</a>, and <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/382" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/382">YouTube</a>.</p>', 'Social media is evolving and fluid (even slightly out-of-control).

In reality, social media is good for a lot of business applications, but marketing stands out as an area in which it has great potential. Let''s start with a quick definition of social media:<br><br><strong>Social media is a collection of websites and networks which allows and encourages individuals and businesses to interact and engage with one another by sharing words, interests, and media.&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Some companies have had trouble identifying the marketing opportunities presented by social media, so let''s take a moment to clarify what social media marketing can be and shouldn''t be.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Social media marketing can be:</strong><br><br><strong>A lead and revenue generator </strong>- To a marketer, social media should first and foremost be about driving revenue. However, rather than inundating your followers with traditional advertisements for your products, social media offers a unique opportunity to move your visitors and followers through the<em> <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/26" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/26">inbound marketing</a></em> funnel.<br><br>First, social media can attract strangers to your business and convert those strangers into followers or friends. Next, you need content and <em><a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/319" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/319">calls-to-action (CTAs)</a> </em>to help convert those followers into leads. Once those leads have been introduced to your company and its products or services, you can convert those leads into customers. Finally, social media can turn those happy customers into promoters who will attract more strangers to your network--and the cycle continues.<br><br><strong>A customer service network </strong>- Responding to customer service issues via social media can give a personal touch and show you care about good experience for your customers.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>A brand experience </strong>- You can and should broadcast your brand using social media. According to Nielsen, social media plays an important role in how consumers discover, research, and share information about brands and products--in fact, 60 percent of consumers who researched products online learned about a specific brand through social media. Take advantage of this by permeating your social media networks with all the elements of your brand.<br><br><strong>Social media marketing should not be:</strong><br><br><strong>A chat with customers </strong>- Although social media is a great way to connect with your customers, and you should use it get them interacting with your business, always keep in mind the fact that social media should be about revenue. A good rule of thumb is to start with about 15 minutes per day monitoring social media activity.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>A product page </strong>- Follow the <em><a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/223" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/223">80-20 rule</a></em>--80 percent of your social media activity should be helpful content, while only 20 percent should be related to sales or products. This focuses your communication toward your audience and minimizes self-promotion.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>A traditional PR channel</strong> - A classic example of how not to use social media is to communicate serious public relations messages with it. Ferrero, the company that makes Nutella, sent a cease-and-desist letter to a group of fans who violated copyright laws by starting a World Nutella Day event online. After clearing up the PR disaster, Ferrero apologized for the action with this Facebook post:&nbsp;<br><br><em>"The case arose from a routine brand defense procedure that was activated as a result of some misuse of the Nutella brand on the fan page."&nbsp;</em><br><br>This is not the type of response you want to use social media for, where responses should be light and engaging. Instead, Ferrero could have offered Facebook fans and apology and a coupon for their products in response to a CTA.&nbsp;<br><br>Although there are so many different social networks out there, the marketing principles addressed in this article apply to the entire world of social media.

Investors use this figure to compare your business to other investment opportunities. To find your ROI, divide your business'' net profit by its net worth.</p><p>It is important to recognize that ROI is not the same as profit. Profit measures the performance of the company, while ROI contrasts the amount spent with amount returned. One way to do this is to take the gain of an investment, subtract the cost of the investment, and then divide the total by the cost of investment.</p><p>For example, if you buy 10 shares of Bob''s Deli Sandwiches for $10 a share, your investment cost is $100. If you sell those shares for $150, then your ROI is ($150-100)/$100 for a total of 0.50 or 50 percent. This can be confirmed by taking the cost of $100 and multiplying by 1.50, yielding $150.</p><p>ROI is a dividend payout. To understand this, picture each&nbsp;stock&nbsp;paying 50 cents to you. Putting more money in the stock will make a larger payout, but the ROI will be the same. It will be 50 percent whether $100 grows to $150 or $15,000.</p><p>Some other ways to calculate ROI are:</p><ul><li>Dividing net income, interest, and taxes by total liabilities to measure rate of earnings of total capital employed.</li><li>Dividing net income and income taxes by proprietary equity and fixed liabilities to produce a rate of earnings on invested capital.</li><li>Dividing net income by total capital plus reserves to calculate the rate of earnings on proprietary equity and stock equity.</li></ul><p>The best method to calculate ROI is the cash flow method. When presenting a ROI plan to an investor, don''t assume that the ROI rate will be the same every year. For instance, your company might do really well the first few years, making a consistent return and then start to decline five years down the road. Or it could grow steadily every year.

According to Hubspot, inbound marketing is about creating and sharing content with the world. By sharing content specifically designed to appeal to your dream customers, inbound marketing attracts qualified prospects to you business and keeps them coming back for more.&nbsp;<br><br>Inbound marketing can be thought of as a funnel. The broad end of the funnel represents the entire market of strangers to your company, while the narrow end of the funnel represents happy customers. This journey from stranger to happy customer is achieved in four steps.<br><br><strong>Attract </strong>- The first step of inbound marketing is attracting the right kind of customer with the highest potential to become a happy customer. Your company''s ideal customer is known as its buyer persona. These ideal customers can be first attracted by outstanding content and information on your blog, social media, and website, and through your company''s prominent appearance in their internet searches.<br><br><strong>Convert </strong>- Next, your company needs to convert those ideal customers who have already been attracted to your company into leads by collecting their contact information.

Unfortunately, many small business owners are unsure how to utilize this tool.&nbsp;<br><br>Here are four steps to optimizing your email marketing strategy:<br><br></p><ol><li><strong>Integrate Channels </strong>- Your first priority should be to integrate social media with email marketing. This integration should include content, links, and tracking data. To make this integration easier, use marketing software like HubSpot, which automatically fuses your various inbound marketing efforts. Next, focus on broadcasting the right message to the right audience by developing content that appeals to your <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/286" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/286"><em>buyer persona</em></a>.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Improve Deliverability </strong>- Deliverability is the rate of emails that make it to receivers'' inboxes versus the total number sent. If emails don''t reach the intended inboxes, it means they have "bounced back," which can be due to a "hard bounce," which is caused by a bad or nonexistent email address, or a "soft bounce," usually caused by a full receiver inbox. If your deliverability rate dips too low, you may be blocked by some internet service providers (ISPs). Keep this from happening by noting bounces and deleting addresses that fail more than once. If low deliverability rates become a problem, you can ask leads to enter their email addresses twice, or even ask them to respond to a verification email.<br><br></li><li><strong>Grow Reach </strong>- Don''t purchase email lists. Instead, earn your contacts by providing valuable information or special offers. Research shows that frequency does not negatively impact lead engagement, so email often. To increase lead engagement, experiment with your content to make sure you are sending the right message to the right audience.

Beneath the perceived success of a man who spends all his time and energy at work is a guy who is wasting away inside--and often unaware. Just like any other addiction, work can consume the mind, the heart, and have physical repercussions on the body. While a workaholic may feel he is successful because of the approval of a boss or new promotion, he will never feel satisfied by any amount of achievement; he will always want to work more.<br><br>"The greater the workload, the more damage you can do to your social life, your health and your emotional well being. If you think that being a workaholic is honorable, think again. In the long run, it will hurt your career more than help it." --&nbsp;Jasper Anson<br><br>In fact, according to <em>Psychology Today</em>, in Japan, workaholism is called "karoshi"--death by overwork--and it''s estimated to cause 1,000 deaths per year. It also causes nearly 5 percent of that country''s stroke and heart attack deaths in employees under age 60.<br><br>However, American''s don''t tend to see workaholism as a bad thing. Joan R. Kofodimos from&nbsp; Center for Creative Leadership points out that, "long hours, repeated relocation, and frequent travel are treated as proof of commitment and loyalty throughout the manager''s career. Conversely, reluctance to make these trade-offs is thought to reflect a lack of dedication."&nbsp;<br><br>When overworking is not being praised, it is being joked about. All one has to do to discover a typical American perception of workaholism is tune in to the TV comedy series <em>Workaholics</em>. Overworking is seen as a joke, not a serious problem.<br><br>This can be because many Americans want to justify their "need" to work more. According <em>Psychology Today</em>, an addiction to work can literally give a chemical high through an increased release of dopamine in a person who gets adrenaline from success at work.&nbsp;<br><br>Many who struggle with an addiction to work need the high that it gives them in order to prove to themselves or a second party that they can be successful. Research shows that many addicts come from a childhood of abuse, had an alcoholic parent, or extreme poverty, and thus need to control their adult lives to rise above their past through perceived success. Others have a drive for perfection based on a belief that nothing they do is good enough--they must try harder and achieve more.&nbsp;<br><br>"The lure of mastery is compelling, and often an individual who has experienced the satisfactions of mastery increasingly defines his identity and purpose in terms of the mastery drive." - Joan R. Kofodimos<br><br>A person''s identity eventually gets wrapped into his job, while his personal life deteriorates. Eventually work becomes an excuse to avoid confronting the stresses at home.<br><br>When a workaholic is at home, all he can think about is work, whether it is job related or not. He may come home only to finish painting the shed, re-arrange his office or wash the car. He never stops to relax because the moment he does, he begins to feel guilty. Instead of helping himself, though, he actually hurts his body and ruins his relationships.<br><br>The American Journal of Epidemiology reported on a global study showing that overworkers are between 40 and 80 percent more likely to suffer heart disease than others.

It measures the output gap (how much is put out versus how much brought in).<br><br>?Spending that is included when determining the fiscal multiplier is that of private investors, consumers, the government, and foreigners buying the country''s exports. When the ratio number exceeds one, it is called the multiplier effect.<br><br>The multiplier effect refers to the amount of money available in the economy to be spent to make more money. The initial incremental spending leads to consumer spending, which increases income, and then increases consumption. A rise in demand causes a rise in output.<br><br>Multipliers less than one crowd out private investment or consumer spending that would have taken place. When there is a low multiplier, banks have higher reserve requirements. Meaning that if a bank customer deposits $100, the reserve requirement might be 50 percent, allowing the bank to loan only $50 to other bank customers. This gives less leeway for loans to be taken out for major purchases that would create more revenue like, for example, a sports stadium. Crowding out can also happen because of increased interest rates or price level due to a low multiplier.<br><br>When there is a high multiplier, however, more money is available to be spent because there is usually a lower reserve requirement in the bank. Instead of a 50 percent rate, it might be 20, giving $80 to be available for loans and investments by the bank.<br><br>More spending can create more revenue, including tax revenue. For example, when Joe Shmoe buys a car, he pays taxes, expenses, and commission on the car. The money is given to the dealer. The dealer now has a larger income and has to pay tax on his new income. The government that spent money to originally invest in making the car, will get back most of the money invested, if not more. The idea is that the net increase of income will be greater than that of the original investment.<br><br>According to the&nbsp; National Bureau of Economic Research, the fiscal multiplier depends critically on conduct of monetary policy. During a financial crisis the multiplier is larger. This could be because during a recession, savings rates are usually higher and capital is not fully utilized by the private market.<br><br>Larger multipliers bring larger negative impacts than expected on basis of conventional multiplier estimates.<br><br>The multiplier effect has been used to argue government spending or taxation relief to bring more overall demand.

When deciding the type of real estate that works best for your business, take into account the type of business you''re operating. If you provide a consulting service, you could work from home and rent access to a conference room. If you are an online-only retail business, you''ll need a warehouse that can keep up with your expanding inventory. If you''re a physical retail store, you''ll need a great commercial location that draws customers.&nbsp;<br><br>There are a few general considerations to keep in mind to help determine your business'' location needs.<br><br></p><ul><li><strong>Size</strong> - Your location should not only be big enough to support your business now, but should also be able to support any plans for growth you have over the next several years. You''ll need more space if you have a lot of office employees or if you sell retail goods.<br><br></li><li><strong>Accessibility </strong>- Your business needs to be in an area where it is easily accessible to its clientele or supply and distribution lines. For example, if your business is a retail store, keep transportation options in mind so customers can easily get there. Main roads, public transportation stops, and parking space will all be important. Or, if you''re a manufacturing business, you''ll need access to supply and distribution lines. In this case, railroads and interstate highways will be important.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Neighborhood and Zone</strong>- Depending on your type of business, you might need to avoid certain neighborhoods or make a point of locating in other ones. Retail stores should be located in commercial zones with plenty of shopping traffic, while services should be accessible to well-educated employees. Research local zones and get information about demographics from the US Census at www.census.gov.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Facility </strong>- Unless you plan to build your own facility, you''ll need to take the building itself into consideration. This need varies greatly from one type of business to another. A retail store, for instance, will need room for inventory display.&nbsp;<br><br></li></ul><p>In addition to these main points, you''ll also need to consider the location''s proximity to already established competitors.

According to entrepreneur.com, the healthiest corporate balance sheets include some level of debt. Financing through debt occurs when a business takes out a loan and then promises to pay back it back. Often, a lender will require a guarantee from the owner''s personal financial assets in a secured loan. If the loan is not paid back on time, the lender will seize assets from the owner.&nbsp; In an unsecured loan, the lender typically only accepts your credit reputation as a guarantee of security.<br><br>The advantages of debt financing include:<br><br></p><ul><li>Interest paid on loans is tax deductible<br><br></li><li>Creditors have little or no control over your business<br><br></li><li>Payments don''t fluctuate, so you can properly budget<br><br></li><li>After the loan is payed back, your business relationship ends<br><br></li></ul><p>However financing through debt has several disadvantages. Impaired credit ratings can blemish your reputation. If you over-extend your funds, you may make your business a risky investment. You also risk being unable to pay back the loan due to an unforeseen economy recession, and your assets could be seized.&nbsp;<br><br>Equity financing is another method to fund your company. Instead of taking out a loan, private equity investors, also known as <em>venture capitalists</em>, and <em>angel investors</em>, buy private stock in your company. In return for the money they give you, you grant them partial ownership of the company, including rights to make decisions.<br><br>Advantages of equity financing include:</p><ul><li>Investors take all the risk<br><br></li><li>If the company crashes, you will not have to pay back money<br><br></li><li>You do not have to make loan payments<br><br></li><li>Investors understand that growing a business to make profit is a long term process<br><br></li></ul><p>However, you will also have to make some sacrifices to benefit from equity financing. First, you have to give the investor part of your company--this includes sharing profits and decision-making. Most investors will want to own at least 50 percent. The return that you give them on their share may cost you more than paying back a loan would, especially void of the tax deduction. According to springboardenterprises.com, the average venture capitalist usually makes a 25 percent return on investments, whereas a typical debt rate is 15 percent. A second disadvantage for small business owners is the difficulty of obtaining an investor. Most venture capitalist are looking for companies with a global reach. Once a corporation has an investor, the only way to get rid of him is to buy him out, which can be very expensive.<br><br>There is a third option called convertible debt, which uses both equity and debt to finance a business. Convertible debt starts out as a loan which the company promises to repay. If the company meets requirements, such as having a certain amount of revenue, raising money from outside sources, or gaining certain market share, it turns into equity stake in the company. Convertible debt gives investors security by promising to pay back the loan, until the company proves its strength. At that point the agreement in annulled because the investor is convinced of the investment value and becomes an equity owner instead of a lender.<br><br>According to journalofaccountancy.com, CPAs should advise their clients that a flow-through deduction is available for a stockholder loan only if there is clear evidence that the corporation is liable to the stockholder. In other words, if a person who holds stock in the company takes out a personal loan and then loans that to the corporation, it will make him economically poor. This proves to the bank that the company is indebted to it. The corporation can then pay back the loan in full--this will allow him to deduct taxes from the debt.<br><br>?To read more, see<a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/139" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/139"> </a><em><a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/139" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/139">Financing Your Busines</a>s</em>, <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/106" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/106"><em>Venture Capitalist</em></a>,&nbsp; or <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/96" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/96"><em>Angel Investors</em>.</a></p>', 'To be a thriving enterprise in the corporate world, it is important to fund your business wisely.

If an employee who usually works hard is struggling to focus, give him a task that takes him out of his normal responsibilities. This will keep him interested and make him feel important, as though his opinion and expertise are recognized beyond his usual job title. A small break from his daily routine may be just what he needs to come back and focus on his own responsibilities.<br><br>Another way is to infuse a new dose of <em>vision</em> into your employee.

This style offers more self-managing among the team members versus direct management from a supervisor.

Team-based management develops more opportunity for change and flexibility within the different roles on the team.

Attitudes towards large corporations have continued to decline in the U.S. over the last several years, from both liberal and conservative parties.<br><br>Texas Senator Ted Cruz, tea party advocate, insists "calling Republicans the party of big business is the biggest lie in politics." From the tea party, who cries for minimal government, to the other side of the political spectrum with a desire for maximum government, many hold the same negative view of corporations. In the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>, Karl Marx described his view large corporations and the "destruction of local culture" that they cause. A similar view is held in every communist and socialist country, its leaders focusing on the small companies that are seemingly over run by the larger ones.<br><br>Negative perception of large corporations seeping through America may not be entirely justified. Many U.S. Fortune 500 companies started as small businesses. For instance, Apple Inc. started in a garage by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Their hard work created today''s mega corporation, but many have forgotten the company''s humble beginnings. Now that Apple has become a large corporation, many feel negatively about the company. It begs the question, how large can a small business grow before it is frowned upon in society? How successful can someone be before praise turns to scorn?&nbsp;<br><br>Many who view large corporations negatively fail to see the benefits they give to an economy, and to small businesses. For example, large corporations create competition, which promotes higher quality and lower prices. They also provide opportunities for small-business growth, letting garage "Apples" turn into billion-dollar companies. Without the incentive for growth and success, people are less likely to completely dedicate themselves to hard work or innovation. Large corporations also have larger voices than small businesses do.&nbsp;<br><br>A small business can explore new areas of a market and get the ball rolling on a new movement. However a small business can only have a voice that reaches so far. A large corporation that joins a movement can use its voice to reach the world. For instance going green with a certain product or boycotting an issue is much more effective with a large corporation behind it.&nbsp;<br><br>However, those against large corporations have valid reasons. Big businesses can be detrimental to a small company who doesn''t know how to compete. For instance local bookstores who fight with corporations like Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble, or local grocers who battle Walmart. Because of globalization and outsourcing, they have a wider consumer. They also have access to cheaper manufacturing, which often is unethical, using underpaid third-world workers, or human trafficking victims to save a quick buck. Large corporations also create more waste and use more energy, adding pollution.<br><br>Large corporations can add as many jobs as they steal from small business, if a small business knows how to utilize them. For instance, small businesses can offer services to large corporations, such as catering, lawn care, or plumbing. They can also build good relationships with corporation owners and partner with them to have a voice for a cause. Another way a small business can benefit from a corporation, is to change their product or service. For instance, Leo Sun, a reporter from businessdictionary.com says, "If a McDonalds comes to town, stop selling regular burgers and start selling something local." Add a new sauce or side dish. Innovative ideas will keep your company fresh and relative in a competitive market.<br><br>?Large corporations, much like anything else, have pros and cons.

Perhaps you spend every day doing what everyone else does: working, eating, shopping, sleeping, and doing it all over again. Yet you sense deep restlessness that you choose to ignore, if only to keep your job and paycheck. Few take time to analyze the inner struggle that accompanies monotony and boredom. At some point everyone dreams of being great. But when expectations are unmet and the daily grind becomes a chore, life loses a touch of its fullness.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The phrase "the daily grind" came from a period of time when the Anglo-Saxons daily ground wheat and corn kernels to make flour for bread to avoid starving before the fall of the Roman Empire.</p><p><br></p><p>The daily grind continues in the form of a predictable and monotonous work day. Sometimes routine tasks become so boring that motivation is difficult. You wonder if your life is missing something that could catapult you into greatness, into a more exciting lifestyle. But you continue to go through the motions of your daily responsibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps greatness does not always mean excitement. Humans need to experience true fulfillment that many believe can only come with greatness. This could be perceived to be many different things: a promotion, a better job, more money, fame, popularity and so on. However few see greatness as monotony. But what if greatness meant more than fame or money? What if greatness could be found in even the most boring routines? Maybe life was not meant to be lived with a focus on personal excitement, but on finding beauty in the little things. For instance, consider a construction worker who notices the gentle breeze through the trees as he builds, or the baker who enjoys the smell of fresh bread as he bakes. Thankfulness for the little gifts can be a ray of sunshine in a boring atmosphere.</p><p><br></p><p>Perhaps some of the greatest people have been the most loyal to the grind of daily life. Though they may never have their names in lights or receive a crowd''s applause, they are the foundation for others who do. Without people who adhere to the daily grind, the world would cease to produce essentials for daily living, such as plumbing, electricity, food, clothing, and education. Committed people provide the necessities for excelling.</p><p><br></p><p>As Isaac Newton once said, "If I have seen farther it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." Giants are not always people who are already famous or live an exhilarating lives, but by their presence a foundation for greatness is laid.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>For instance, consider the elementary basketball coach, committed to teaching the rules of the game day after day, who never dreamed that one of his players would grow up to be in the NBA. Or consider the grocery shelf stocker who never realized the products he stocks keep people from starving. People like these, who are committed to the responsibility of everyday tasks, are greater than they may realize.</p><p><br></p><p>While no one dreams of being a stepping stool for others, something can be said of the one who is willing to make little of himself to benefit others. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "A great man is always willing to be little." Anyone can put himself first, but it takes true strength to hold someone else up. You may not think your daily grind is benefitting anyone, but it is.</p><p><br></p><p>Imagine how each task you complete will satisfy your next customer. Envision the over-arching purpose of your product or service and its impact on the world. Consider how dedication will propel you farther in your career. Runners get to the finish line by putting one foot in front of the other, over and over.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Next time you want to give up on the daily grind, remember why you do what you do. Your work matters. If it didn''t, you wouldn''t be paid. Don''t give up just because you lack fame or money. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, "Not everybody can be famous but everybody can be great, because greatness is determined by service." You may never know how your dedication to your work can make an impact on another person''s life. Meanwhile, look for the little gifts you can be thankful for--thankfulness sees greatness in even the trivial.</p><p><br></p>', 'Does your daily routine make you great?

Though it will bring benefits to some, it also brings plenty of uncertainties. One of these uncertainties is exactly how it will affect small businesses, which President Obama has called the backbone of the U.S. economy.<br><br>Although no one knows exactly how the law will affect small businesses, general perception among owners is that it will be harmful. According to a May 2013 Gallup poll, small business owners believe the ACA will bring trouble in three different areas:<br><br><strong>Small businesses </strong>- 48 percent of those polled believe the ACA will be bad for business, while only 9 percent believe it will be good for business.<br><br><strong>Health care quality </strong>- 52 percent of participants believe the ACA will reduce health care quality, while only 13 percent believe it will improve quality.<br><br><strong>Health care costs </strong>- 55 percent of those surveyed believe the ACA will raise health care costs, while only 5 percent believe it will lower costs.<br><br>These numbers are just perception. What are the actual issues the ACA will present to small businesses?<br><br>First, the government will penalize any business that employs 50 or more full-time employees and does not provide health insurance. The penalty will be $2,000 per employee, minus the first 30 employees. Thus, a business that employs 50 employees but chooses not to provide health care will pay $40,000.<br><br>Second, there are real concerns that Obamacare is already causing health insurance companies to raise their premiums. This is mostly due to the ACA''s pre-existing condition mandate. Under this mandate, insurance companies are required to accept people with pre-existing conditions at the same rates as other low-risk individuals. This does not make financial sense for insurance companies, so most will raise premiums to compensate.<br><br>Third, if an employer inadequately provides healthcare according to the ACA, the business risks a $3,000 penalty per employee who receives a federal subsidy through state insurance exchanges.<br><br>Businesses with fewer than 50 employees will not be penalized and will probably feel the least affect of Obamacare, although they may be hurt by rising costs.<br><br>To learn how other small businesses are handling the challenges presented by Obamacare, read <em><a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/112" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/112">How to Navigate the Affordable Care Act</a>.</em></p>', 'Though it will bring benefits to some, it also brings plenty of uncertainties.

In order to successfully navigate the law when it is fully implemented in 2013, you''ll need to strategically identify health care options and select the best one for your business. This article will provide an example of how one small business is navigating Obamacare, and give you a step-by-step process.<br><br>For Capterra, a small business software firm in Virginia with 23 employees, health care is already its third highest expense. Capterra''s current plan pays 100 percent of employees'' premiums and 75 percent of their families'' premiums. Unfortunately, Capterra''s current provider decided to raise rates by 28 percent, giving the company four options:<br><br></p><ol><li>Keep the same plan and absorb the costs. This would not only force Capterra to absorb the 28 percent rate increase, but would also force employees'' families to pay the same increase on their 25 percent.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br></li><li>Keep the same plan and shift some of the costs. Under this plan, Capterra would begin to charge employees 25 percent of their individual premiums.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br></li><li>Keep the provider but change to a cheaper plan. This would mean lowering premiums but adding a<strong> </strong>higher deductible, which could cause employees and their families to pay as much as $1,000 per doctor visit.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Switch to another provider that has not increased rates yet. This would be a risky move, since the new provider could raise rates in the near future, in which case Capterra would be back to square one.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Stop paying health care benefits and switch to cash payment. In this case, employees would be encouraged to invest their extra cash in untaxed<a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/297" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/297"> <em>health savings accounts</em>.</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br></li></ol><p>This example illustrates the scarcity of options for a small business like Capterra. Companies with 50 to 200 full time employees would be penalized for the fifth option, reducing its viability. Businesses of this size will be particularly strained, since they are large enough to be penalized but too small to negotiate the best rates for their health care provision.<br><br>With this example in mind, begin navigating Obamacare with these steps:<br><br></p><ol><li>Find out how many full-time employees you have.This sounds like a simple calculation, but it proves<s> </s>complex under government regulation. The U.S. government considers full-time equivalent (FTE) employees to be those who were scheduled 40 hours per week when averaged over a month. In fact, two part-time employees who averaged 20 hours per week are considered one FTE. A business with variable-hour staff can use the following calculation: add the total number of hours worked by employees in a year and divide that number by 2,080 (40 hours per week multiplied by 52 weeks).<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br></li><li>Keep an eye on health care rates. Depending on your current healthcare provider''s planned increases, your business might need to consider alternatives. Examine how increased rates would affect your company. Unless your company pays 100 percent of all premiums, increased rates will have ripple effects that reach your employees and their families.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Consider your options. If your current plan is hurting both the company and its employees, or will begin to in the near future, make a list of options. Health care<strong> </strong>affects your employees as much as it affects your business, so keep your employees informed. If transparency is important to your company, include your employees in the decision making process.</li></ol>', 'The Affordable Care Act presents a number of challenges to small businesses.

Aristotle said, "To avoid criticism, say nothing, do nothing, be nothing." Since everyone will experience it, understanding how to receive criticism without becoming negatively affected by it is important.&nbsp;<br><br>When someone approaches you with critical feedback, you should listen first, talk later. By listening well, you can best understand what the person is saying and why. Part of listening is asking good questions, such as requesting specific examples or possible solutions.&nbsp;<br><br>After listening, respond--don''t react. Reacting is emotion-controlled, while responding is&nbsp; self-controlled. If his criticism makes you angry, let him know you need a few minutes to think over his comment and come back in a few hours or even the next day, when you have calmed down. Try to separate the subjective from the objective, to understand what feedback is important to consider and which to discredit.

Your starting idea may be good, but with feedback from others it can be better. Winston Churchill said, "Criticism may not be agreeable, but it is necessary. It fulfills the same function as pain in the human body. It calls attention to an unhealthy state of things." Feedback from others could point out flaws that you haven''t realized yet.&nbsp;<br><br>When receiving criticism, remember not take it personally.

However, leaders often struggle with internal fears and insecurities that are kept hidden. Fears of failure, inadequacy, rejection, uncertainty, losing control, high expectations, or discovering they''re not good enough, are just a few fears leaders struggle with.<br><br>If not dealt with correctly, these fears can consume a leader and prevent him from becoming all that he could be. They often lead to his eventual demise. Fear is potent because it clouds a person''s entire attitude. In the same way that dirty sunglasses can make anything look less beautiful, so can a view of the world fogged up by fear. Truly beautiful circumstances and people can lose their luster when a leader is too gripped by fear to take advantage of leading them.<br><br>A leader needs to learn how to overcome fear. He needs to renew his mind to clean the fear fog from his worldview glasses and begin to view the world differently. One way to do this is to take the focus off himself. Fear can often revolve around worry about the leader''s personal reputation, identity or security. When a leader moves the focus from himself to the problem at hand or the people beneath him, he begins to think less about his fear and more about what he is leading.<br><br>Rosa Parks said, "I have learned over the years that when one''s mind is made up, this diminishes fear; knowing what must be done does away with fear."&nbsp;<br><br>To overcome fear, a leader needs to have a proper view of failure.

''Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but he whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death."<br><br>People can respect someone who has faced failure and adversity and grown from it.

That''s why it''s important to break SEO methodology into easy-to-understand steps, which is what we''ll attempt to do next.&nbsp;<br><br>We learned in <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/59" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/59"><em>What is SEO?</em></a> that search engines rank websites primarily based on two criteria:<br><br></p><ol><li><strong>Content </strong>- A website must feature pages that are interesting to new visitors, especially home pages and those that have practical use, like guides, resources, and FAQs. Content should follow the <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/223" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/223">80/20</a> rule: 80 percent of content should be non-branded, and 20 percent should be branded.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Authority </strong>- Search engines want to know your content is popular on social media. Most important, your website must have many inbound links from other sites to yours. The more your site is referenced by others, the more trust Google has in its worth.&nbsp;<br><br></li></ol><p>How do search engines process all that information and compile ranks for every possible search? By using keywords. &nbsp;<br><br>Keywords are the basic driving component of SEO and search engines. They are the words typed during an internet search for products, services, and answers. To maximize the effectiveness of your SEO, select the right keywords to use in internet marketing. Remember that keyphrases can be as effective as keywords.&nbsp;<br><br>To select your keywords, begin by asking simple but specific questions about your brand. If your company sells bicycles, don''t just pick the keyword "bicycles." This word is too general for your business to compete for top search results. Instead, consider making your keyphrase "mountain bikes," or another specialized type of bikes you sell.<em> </em>If you serve a specific area, it''s always a good idea to make that area one of your keywords. For instance, a mountain bike shop in Boulder, Colorado, should aim to be one of the top results when a user Googles "mountain bikes in Boulder."<br><br>Break down traffic analysis to branded and non-branded search terms. Users determine search result relevance by reading the description first, title second, and URL third. This means you should write for human beings, not search engines. Don''t just write strings of keywords--this will drive away human users and Google will be able to tell you''re trying to play the system. Place keywords naturally yet strategically.&nbsp;<br><br>Write helpful, accurate content regularly and post this content on your blog and social media. Encourage third-party sharing of your content, which will boost Google''s trust in your relevance.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, experiment with photos and video--these media get more attention from search engines than written content and boost your relevance.<br><br>After taking all these SEO steps, install analytics software like HubSpot or Google analytics. These programs will allow you to track the success of your SEO efforts. Never stop experimenting with keyphrases or introducing new types of media.</p>', 'The goal of SEO is to improve your rank in search results, but how is this accomplished?

But when it is a decision you have to make, here is a basic five step process that can help reduce the potential conflict and drama before you schedule the meeting.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Make sure it''s unavoidable.</strong> Determine that everything possible has been done&nbsp; to equip and provide opportunity for the individual to meet expectations and change behavior. The investment&nbsp; your company made when hiring and training him/her should cause you to pause and make sure you''re not making the decision hastily. Whatever the reason, and as much as possible, firing an employee should not come as a huge surprise to the employee (or your superiors).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Anticipate adjustments. </strong>Before setting the meeting, review and prioritize&nbsp; which of the terminated individual''s responsibilities will be divvied up or assigned to other employees. Do not tell the person(s) who will be assigned the tasks until after you have let the individual go.</li><li><strong>Know your state laws.</strong> Each state has specific laws regarding what&nbsp; to provide to the individual upon termination. Be in contact with your Human Resources department, or your&nbsp; attorney. Also, refer to your company''s policies and/or handbook for guidelines. For example, at some companies, approval is required from your superiors&nbsp; before you terminate an employee.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Consider&nbsp; timing. </strong>It''s recommended to meet with the employee&nbsp; any day of the week before noon (then the individual can leave the office as if leaving for the lunch hour), or at an hour before close on Friday (then the individual can leave as if leaving for the day). This gives the terminated employee the opportunity to leave without causing&nbsp; awkward attention from&nbsp; other employees, and limits drama. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Have support. </strong>When you meet with the individual, if possible, have a trained Human Resource counselor join. If the individual being let go is of the opposite sex than you,&nbsp; include another witness&nbsp; to protect you from accusations caused by an angry ex-employee.

Here are eight guidelines to help you maintain control during the termination meeting.&nbsp;<br><br></p><ol><li><strong>Get to the point.</strong> State the reason for the meeting immediately. Don''t ask about the person''s spouse and kids, just get to the point. Keep it simple and direct.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Avoid a debate.</strong> Don''t give an opening for him/her to argue with your decision and reasons. Avoid&nbsp; over explaining why the employee is being terminated. The less said, the better. Stick to the facts without providing a personal commentary. If previous meetings have occurred where &nbsp; improvement was encouraged,&nbsp; yet no improvements were made, you can mention that ("We''ve met on several occasions to discuss this area, and despite repeated counseling and warnings, no improvement has been made within the timeframe given. Because of this, I''m sorry, but you are dismissed."). Don''t mention other employee''s names as this could cause additional debates of "he said, she said." Stand strong on your decision, state the reason as simply as possible, and then dismiss the individual.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Listen, but don''t react.</strong> Stay professional. Even if you have a personal relationship, maintain a professional distance during this meeting. Understand that the individual may get angry and lash out. Don''t engage. Again, the less said, the better. Stand strong, listen out of respect, but professionally move the meeting forward by directing the individual to the next step.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Have the details ready.</strong> If the termination is not effective immediately, have the official end date set. Have severance pay arrangements ready to explain. If&nbsp; other career counseling opportunities are offered by your company, refer the individual to them. Have a checklist of all company equipment, passwords, and keys, that the individual will immediately need to return. Prepared ahead so&nbsp; you don''t forget something. If the employee worked in good faith, but didn''t fit the position due to training, experience, or personality, you may offer a recommendation letter&nbsp; for another employer.<br><br></li><li><strong>Walk with him/her.</strong> Don''t let the employee go back to their office/cubicle by themselves. Help them quietly gather their personal belongings before they leave. Explain that their personal decorations and such will be collected, and they will be contacted to return to get them at a later time. This avoids an angered employee from causing damage, or taking company equipment or resources (client contact information and the like).&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Debrief with the staff.</strong> After the individual leaves, gather the staff, and explain in generalities (and within confidentiality limits) what occurred. Anticipate that some will fully understand the decision, but others may have a harder time with it. You can''t always see the full picture of the emotional connections the individual had on other co-workers. Refocus the staff into a pattern of operating without the individual, and let them return to work. If you choose, this may be an opportunity, to discuss &nbsp; rehiring for that position.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Document what happened. </strong>In the employee file, document in detail what was said, done, and how the individual responded. Should anything come up later, you''ll need to have the documentation.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Move forward together. </strong>When all is said and done, move on. Terminating an employee can be an emotionally raw experience, even if it''s absolutely necessary. But don''t linger there. Instead, shift your focus to your staff, and&nbsp; helping them adjust, while still working to their full potential. Intentionally interact with your staff in the coming weeks to&nbsp; reassure job security and&nbsp; confirm that you don''t spontaneously let employees go. Focus on how to best move forward together.&nbsp;<br><br></li></ol><p>For guidelines to help you prepare for this kind of meeting, click <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/146" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/146"><em>here</em></a>.

Nonverbal communication is used to accentuate, substitute , or even contradict the verbal message. According to Suzanne Jones, associate professor of communications at the University of Minnesota, 65 to 75 percent of all communication is nonverbal.</p><p><br></p><p>Nonverbal cues include facial expressions, hand gestures, body movements, touch, personal space, and dress. How you use each affects your <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/219" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/219"><em>office culture</em></a>, brand reputation, and professionalism. Nonverbal communication has the power to make or break your growing business. As a leader, you set the tone for nonverbal communication in your workplace.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Let''s take a closer look at how these areas of nonverbal communication can affect your business life.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Eye Contact</strong> - It''s important to maintain eye contact when speaking with others. This is a sign of respect which builds personal connection, increases rapport, and shows you are paying attention to what the other person is communicating. Keep eye contact going every few seconds. If you stare, it can be perceived as rude&nbsp;or intimidating. When speaking out loud to a group, make eye contact with different individuals throughout the audience, not focusing on one person or area of the room for the entire time.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Gestures</strong> - When using your hands to speak, be mindful that it doesn''t become distracting. Use movements to emphasize a specific point, show an example, or depict confidence when speaking. When listening, gestures are equally important. When crossing your arms, you can appear bored or even hostile. Tapping your fingers says you''re bored or uninterested in the conversation. Folding your hands or having them at your side when listening to others portrays an interest in what is being verbally communicated. In the same sense, offering a firm hand shake when greeting another shows confidence.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Proximity</strong> - Be respectful of personal space. Encroaching on another''s personal space can be intimidating and uncomfortable. Read nonverbal cues when speaking to others. If they step backward, do not step forward--they have just nonverbally communicated with you that they need more space. On the other hand, do not be so far away that it appears that you are shouting or disrupting the personal space of others around you. When talking with someone, stand close enough to show interest and respect for what is being said.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Posture</strong> - Sitting up straight or leaning in slightly when another person is speaking are signs of respect and interest. Slouching, or leaning back in your chair, can show boredom, insecurity, and over-confidence. Your overall demeanor when standing and sitting can make a big impact on your co-workers and clients.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Facial Expression</strong> - When listening to others, be aware of what your face is saying back to them. Focusing on the words they are speaking and making eye contact is important. Furrowing your brow can show that you disagree or are skeptical of what they are saying. Frowning can display doubt or anger. Smiling slightly or nodding occasionally during a conversation or presentation shows interest in the verbal message.&nbsp;<br><br></li></ul><p>Other nonverbals to take into account are dress, the volume of your voice, and timeliness.

Your name will represent your brand to countless potential customers.&nbsp;<br><br>Your name should:<br><br></p><ul><li><strong>Look good as a logo. </strong>Make sure the name looks good as a logo by itself, and as a part of your other designed logos. Some of the best company names, such as Apple Inc., heavily influence their logo design.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Evoke feelings consistent with your brand. </strong>Invented names can be memorable, but they won''t always help communicate your brand until your marketing efforts are well-established.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Be distinct. </strong>A name should be unique so that customers can easily recognize your company. It is also easier to trademark an uncommon name.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br>With these criteria in mind, you can begin to brainstorm possible names, which will usually fall into the four categories listed below. If you have difficulty choosing a name, consider narrowing your options by choosing one of the following.<br><br><strong>Functional Names </strong>- These names directly describe the services or products offered by the business. Only use these names if your strategy is to shift most of your branding to the name itself. An example of this strategy is Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. In this example, Martha Stewart''s name alone is worth creating an entire brand around. Be cautious with these names, because they are often made up of industry keywords that make it difficult to differentiate your company from others. This makes marketing very difficult.<br><br><strong>Invented Names </strong>- There are two types of invented names: those with Greek or Latin roots, and those that are invented from scratch and built on the experience of saying them.&nbsp;<br><br></p><ul><li>Names with Greek or Latin roots, such as Acquient and Alliant, are unique and thus easy to trademark. These names are free of negative connotations, but only because they are also free of any easily recognizable meaning--they just sound cold and serious. These names do not lend themselves to any marketing strategies, since it takes enormous effort to get potential customers to associate them with your company''s services.<br><br></li><li>Names that are purely invented, like Google or Bing, are built for the rhythm and fun of speaking them. They are emotionally engaging and easy to trademark, market, and remember. It can be difficult to back up the selection of an invented name with quantifiable data, but it is generally worth the effort to determine what your customers prefer.<br><br></li></ul><p><strong>Experiential Names </strong>- These names evoke the experience of using the company''s product or service, often by referencing something real. The Safari web browser is an example of this type of name, meant to conjure images of exploration and discovery. Experiential names excel at communicating what companies do, and sometimes present a self-contained branding opportunity. Unfortunately, they don''t do a great job of differentiating your brand from others in your industry, and can be difficult to trademark.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Evocative Names </strong>- These names don''t describe the function or experience of the business or invent a new word. Instead, they attempt to support the <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/56" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/56"><em>brand positioning</em> </a>of the company. Evocative names are rare and emotionally engaging, making them powerful differentiators. For maximum effectiveness, evocative names must be integrated with a holistic marketing effort. Apple Inc. is a great example of an evocative name which is connected to its apple logo, which is evocative of Apple''s fresh, simple, and clean brand.&nbsp;<br><br>Using the three criteria above as well as these four categories should get you well on your way to choosing a great name for your business.

Customer to customer communication versus mass media ads often carries more weight in the consumer''s decision making process. Consumers are more likely to listen to an opinion when the source has nothing to gain or lose from speaking honestly about the product.&nbsp;<br><br>According to William Daddi, senior vice president at Magnet Communications, "Ultimately, brand is a perception. All public relations--from single and straight-forward publicity to more complex promotions--play a major role in establishing and shaping these perceptions." Utilizing TPEs creates a trust in your brand based on your target market''s interest.<br><br>Today, consumers are able to pick and choose what they read. Because the consumer will drift toward areas of personal interest, it''s important to market your brand message where it will be read. If your brand message is in an editorial that is relevant to the reader, that content is often perceived as having more integrity because it was read in a source that already holds the consumer''s interest. This alone makes your brand applicable to the consumer.&nbsp;<br><br>Using public relations in tandem with marketing to gain TPEs is extremely cost-effective to your business. Take a look at the following suggestions to begin harnessing them.<br><br></p><ol><li>Utilize client testimonials. Spreading the word of a happy customer creates credibility for your business. Client testimonials are powerful ways to tell others about your business. Not only do they spread the word to the public, they also let you know as a business what you are doing correctly. Testimonials can also be slipped directly into your traditional advertisements, giving them more authority. Make sure to get permission from your clients before using their testimonies.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Ask a respected columnist to review your business. By asking to be reviewed, you are guaranteeing that your business will be seen in the media. Remember not to sell your business to the reviewer, but offer your product as it is. Take the critique that is given and learn from it. Continue to ask others to review your products as they are introduced.<br><br></li><li>Target reporters that write about your particular field of business and keep them informed on current happenings in your industry. If your organization is viewed by the media as a source, you gain credibility in your area and trust from the consumer.<br><br></li><li>Send press releases to media outlets that fit your target market. Remember that the consumer chooses what reviews to read. If your content is interesting and you are utilizing media outlets tailored to the target market, your brand becomes more relevant and trustworthy to the consumer.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><br>When using <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/315" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/315">public relations and TPEs</a> it is critical to remember that a bad reputation spreads faster than a good one.

To begin this process, ask, "Why should this lender think my business will succeed and why should they invest in it?"<br><br>Lenders want potential borrowers to have sufficient assets, reserves, and collateral to endure market fluctuations and still be able to make loan payments. A solid cash flow and positive record of success in your business venture increases your appeal in the lender''s eye.&nbsp;<br><br>Here are a few tips to securing a good lender for your business:<br><br></p><ol><li><strong>Look</strong> for banks that are Small Business Administration (SBA) backed. These banks have a small-business focus and are comfortable making investments to fit your growing needs.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Make</strong> sure the lender understands your business and products. This will help the bank make smart investments.

Lenders look for assets when considering small business loans. Take the time to figure out ways to improve your credit if needed.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Seek</strong> consultation from development centers or mentoring services for small businesses.

Either sell your better-quality product for the same price, or sell your equal-quality product at a lower price than your competitors. This is a common strategy in young markets.

The words you choose should be understood by the majority of your participants, regardless of their education or experience. Avoid technical jargon.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Watch out for ambiguity. Even small nuances can affect how a participant interprets the question and response, so be wary of words could be interpreted in different ways. For example, if asking "Where are you from?" do you mean where the participant was born, or where they live now? This also applies to time frame questions. If you ask, "How often do you..." do you mean within the past month or past year or their entire life?&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Keep the question to one topic. You want participants to be able to either agree or disagree with the question, not agree with half and disagree with the other. Divide these questions in two or rewrite them.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Write questions that aren''t leading or loaded, meaning that the question leads the participant to answer how the researcher wants in order to agree with an opinion.

Every business will face crisis at some point, being prepared can make all the difference. Having a firm grasp on <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/175" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/175"><em>public relations</em> </a>and putting a crisis management plan in place can help business owners take that feeling of fear and replace it with confidence.&nbsp;<br><br>A crisis can be anything from employee misconduct, natural disasters, recalls, or the resignation of leadership. One of the most well known business crisis happened in 1982 when Johnson&amp;Johnson recalled over 31 million bottles of extra-strength Tylenol. Seven people died from taking extra-strength Tylenol which had been laced with cyanide. When the news broke, it appeared that Johnson&amp;Johnson would never recover and Tylenol would lose all credibility. However, due to proactive public relations and crisis management, Johnson&amp;Johnson addressed the issue, attempted to correct it by recalling the Tylenol, and put the customer first, by giving them a full refund. Because of this, the company was on track to restore it''s previous market status within a year. Today, Johnson&amp;Johnson remains a pharmaceutical powerhouse.&nbsp;<br><br>When facing a crisis of your own, gather all the facts before communicating anything externally. Figure out what happened and when, who is affected, and how it will be resolved. Take note of any customer or media inquiries regarding the crisis to gauge how quickly the situation has spread. Discuss the issue with your colleagues and notify them immediately when a crisis occurs.<br><br>In many cases, it is beneficial for the company to address those affected first, before they hear about it through a media outlet. For example, if there are compromises to customer credit cards, having a company representative contact the card holder would be better than them hearing about their finances on the evening news. This shows the consumer that your company is aware and in control of the crisis.<br><br>Evaluate how the situation looks to the general public. Chances are, it looks much different in the company''s eyes. Try to see the crisis from the outside perspective. Admit you''ve made a mistake when one has been made.&nbsp;<br><br>Designate a spokesperson to handle all media inquiries and statements regarding the crisis. This individual could be the CEO, owner, or head of your public relations department. Whomever it may be, make sure they are able to represent your brand and values, handle tough questions, and stay composed when addressing the issue at hand.&nbsp;<br><br>Similar to the military, train your employees for a crisis by simulating one. This is one of the best way to assess whether or not your organization is crisis ready. Work through a potential disaster as a team to improve any deficiencies you may find in your crisis management plan. Remember, any crisis your company faces is a part of your story. Instead of hiding, acknowledge the issue head on.

Though email is an important aspect of <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/238" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/238"><em>effective communication</em></a>, beware of these eight common blunders.&nbsp;<br><br></p><ol><li>"Reply-All" is a delicate button. When using email to keep a number of people informed, be sure to respond to everyone by using the "reply-all" button. Leaving someone out can create hard feelings and a loss of information to occur. On the other hand, refrain from cluttering everyone else''s inbox with private comments that are relevant to only one or two others.<br><br></li><li>Tone is important. You may be using sarcasm or humor in an email message, but will it read that way to the recipient? Be careful to not replace written communication standards with verbal ones; they do not always successfully transfer.<br><br></li><li>Read through your message before sending it. Make sure that the message is professional, uses correct punctuation and grammar, and contains all relevant information the first time. For example, if an email is sent regarding a meeting, be sure to include the time, date, and purpose of the meeting in the original email to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth conversation. Take pride in your writing, even in a quick email message.<br><br></li><li>Do not rely on email for all communication. If you are sending an email containing important information that requires a timely response, flag it or click "high priority" so it stands out in the recipient''s inbox. However, if the information requires immediate action, use another form of communication such as a phone call or face to face meeting.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Keep emails to the point. Rambling or drawing out the message will keep your email from being read thoroughly by the recipient, which can result in loss of important information.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Emails are permanent. According to a survey conducted by Sophos, 50 percent of respondents say they have sent an email to the wrong person. You cannot easily "unsend" an email. Once the email reaches an inbox, you can''t get it back. Recall buttons are not instantaneous and often times require action from a company''s IT department, which can take time. Avoid sending an email to the wrong person by writing in the recipients email address only right before sending it. This will also help to avoid sending a half-written email.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Sit on it. When responding to a controversial message, don''t send it right away. Save it as a draft and look at it again later, when emotions have settled. At that time, evaluate the message tone, the recipients, and whether or not it should actually be sent.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Emails are today''s "paper-trail," so be careful about what you leave behind.

The company''s handling of the disaster left them with a seemingly uncontrollable environmental crisis and a plummeting image. In the public relations world, this case has become a commonly analyzed example of what to avoid when facing a crisis.&nbsp;<br><br>Approximately a month after news of the oil spill broke, BP finally attempted to reach out to the public using <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/36" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/36"><em>social media</em></a>, something it had little interest in doing previously. However, the company seemed to be using it more in an effort to keep its image clean than to acknowledge and apologize for the catastrophe.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Failure to harness one of the most influential means of communication tainted the company''s branding claims of being innovative and progressive. Instead of utilizing social media to explain how the company was dealing with the crisis, the general public saw BP as unable to relate. BP''s Facebook page was low-ranked and easily overpowered by "boycott BP" groups. The company also faced a challenge when addressing parody accounts on Twitter, and the negative #oilspill <em><a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/38" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/38">hashtag</a>.</em></p><p><br>BP not only struggled with its social media efforts, but also made several poor decisions through its TV campaign. The company spent a reported $50 million to rebrand through TV adds, but the public felt this $50 million would be better used to help the relief efforts of the oil spill. During the TV campaign, CEO Tony Hayward made the mistake of stating, "I want my life back." This was an effort to show the relentless work being done by BP to remedy the problem, but due to the sensitive nature of the case, including 11 casualties, Hayward was advised to issue an apology. Hayward later had to retract another statement after telling the Associated Press that the spill would be contained to a small leak within a few days.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The company did not utilize social media to encourage two-way conversation. Instead, it turned off the "comments" function on their social media channels, closing off any outside opinions and statements. By doing so, BP appeared inconsiderate and aloof.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Overall, BP''s approach to crisis management in this particular case left them looking unprepared.

Everyone struggles with a few words, so make a list of yours for a quick reference. Utilize spell check and look over your finished draft to ensure there are no typos.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Use active voice, not passive. For example, the active voice would read, "Our department sent the report," instead of the passive, "The report was sent by our department."<br><br></li><li>Avoid using jargon. Even when sending a report or email to clients or customers who are familiar with your business, there are often different interpretations to jargon. Refrain from using nicknames or slang. Keep things clear by using common words to avoid miscommunication.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Sentence composition. Beware of run-on sentences, which are two or more sentences combined into one. Use "and" or "but" or a period to separate your thoughts. Watch for sentence fragments. Identify fragments by noting if your sentence can stand alone when read.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Misuse of commas.

They are often overused in casual contexts, such as emails.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Misuse of contractions. <em>It''s</em> is another way of saying, "it is" or "it has." <em>Its</em> is the possessive form of "it." If the word can be replaced with "it is" or "it has," use "it''s." If it cannot, use "its."<br><br></li><li>Too much/too little information.

Newsletters should be an inviting document that catches your reader''s attention at first glance. Follow these steps to create a newsletter that will keep your customers reading.</p><ol><li><strong>Establish a mission</strong>. Before sending out your newsletter, decide what you want to convey. Will it be promotional, marketing, informative, or relational? Once your mission is decided, develop an individual goal for each newsletter you send. Pick the most important piece of news in the document and make it a "must read." &nbsp;Your readers will expect this theme, so it''s important to inform them ahead of time should you change the tone.<br><br></li><li><strong>Keep your content newsworthy</strong>. A newsletter is a great way to announce new products,&nbsp;services, and&nbsp;industry news, or to address problems and solutions. Hook the reader by presenting content in creative ways. For example, use two or three-part articles and follow-up stories to keep the reader looking forward to the next edition. Link content to&nbsp;your company website or social media sites. Know what your clients want to read and include it in your newsletter.<br><br></li><li><strong>Consider the layout.</strong>&nbsp;Keep the document inviting and consistent by using the same template each time. Cluttered newsletters are unappealing and overwhelming. Include a table of contents for easy navigation and keep the number of images used to ten or less to keep&nbsp;your newsletter from being flagged by spam filters.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Don''t forget about the technicalities.</strong> When sending an email newsletter, don''t use a generic sounding email address such as noreply@example.com or marketing@example.com. These are commonly flagged as spam. It''s important to generate a plain text and HTML&nbsp;version of the newsletter in case some recipient computers are not set up to read an HTML&nbsp;document. Legally, a newsletter requires the sender to include the company name, address, and an unsubscribe link within the email. &nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Choose a frequency.</strong> Once you have your mission and content chosen, decide how often to send your newsletter. Don''t send your newsletter so frequently the reader considers it spam. On the other hand, delaying contact for too long can become confusing and possibly cause your business to beforgotten.&nbsp;Aim for once per month and be willing to adjust according to the needs of the reader and your business.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><strong>Use newsletters as a measuring tool</strong>. By emailing your newsletter through an email softward like Constant Contact, you are able to measure it''s success. Emailing allows you to see who received it, who opened it, if it was forwarded on to others, and who unsubscribed. You can also see the amount of clicks generated to outside links included in the newsletter, if there is increased traffic to your business website, or social media sites.<br><br></li><li><strong>Respect the reader</strong>.&nbsp; The recipient should be able to review the content and have a grasp of what is important within&nbsp;minutes of opening the document.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Newsletters require time and effort, so be sure they are quality, effective publications.

These generations value flexibility, and ROWE allows employees to work whenever and wherever they want, giving them complete control over their time. &nbsp;<br><br>Originally made famous by HR Managers Cali Ressler and Jody Thompson of Best Buy, ROWE measures employee success based on results only. Ressler and Thompson felt that managers were basing employee evaluations on how much time was spent in the office instead of how well employees were accomplishing their goals. CultureRx, a spinoff company started by Ressler and Thompson to expand the ROWE philosophy, defines ROWE as "a management strategy where employees are evaluated on performance, not presence."<br><br>CultureRx says that by focusing on results, employees will have the power to manage their own work. Benefits of ROWE include increased teamwork, accountability, employee retention, and morale, as well as decreased stress and fatigue. Because there is no need for schedule, ROWE advocates there will be little to no judgement on how employees spend their time, which will decrease wasted company time and money.<br><br>Managers who utilize ROWE say they are able to empower their employees through trust and quickly evaluate who is really working and who isn''t. This management style forces clear communication about job expectations and responsibilities. Primarily designed for project/task-based environments, ROWE requires managers to be goal-oriented and effective and employees to be disciplined and self-motivated.&nbsp;<br><br>But is this really the best solution to satisfy the desire for flexibility in the workplace? Best Buy''s newly appointed CEO Hubert Joly does not think so. Following on the heels of Yahoo''s CEO Marissa Mayer, who recently canceled the company''s work-from-home policy, Joly retracted the ROWE style at Best Buy in March. Joly stated the company''s famous management style was "fundamentally flawed from a leadership perspective."&nbsp;<br><br>Joly felt that ROWE was flawed because it required leadership to delegate constantly which may not be effective for every employee. He said, "Depending on the skill of the individual, the right leadership style may be coaching, motivating, or directing rather than delegating."<br><br>This style of management is ill-suited for retail outlets, industrial settings, or other time-sensitive workplaces such as the stock market or medical professions.

Should your business decide to donate to charity, make sure you have the resources to do so. By making it a part of your every day operation, you will avoid overstating the amount you are able to donate.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Be transparent. When deciding to donate, let your employees and customers know exactly where donations are going and what they are helping accomplish. Be open about why the specific charities were chosen.<br><br></li><li>Choose wisely. Research the organization(s) of choice and know exactly what your business is supporting and where its money is going. The Better Business Bureau has additional resources and suggested charities for businesses looking to donate.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Keep it relevant. Aligning charities with the products or services of your business, helps the customer and employee feel more connected to the cause.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Determine how to give. Whether it''s monetary donations, volunteering, sponsorship, product donations, or portions of your business profits and sales, identify the best means for your business to consistently contribute. Again, building this into your company''s financial business plan will ensure you are not donating beyond your means.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Involve the customer. Spotlight the charity you work with on your social media, company website, and other marketing tools.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Consider taxes. If you give to a charity based on purchases made by a customer, your business is entitled to the tax deduction. However, if you want the customer to receive the tax write-off, things can become more complicated and hiring an attorney or accountant familiar with not-for-profit enterprises may be helpful. Check with the IRS to ensure your chosen charity is in fact qualified for tax deductions. Deductible contributions include: cash contributions, gifts of property or equipment, and milage or travel expenses from working on-site with a charitable organization.

Paying attention to how much has been accomplished and how much is left will help a project finish on time and with quality.<br><br>After you set the criteria for the finish line, it is important to make sure your project stays on task so you can meet them. Some projects are so large or spread out that it may be difficult to track their progress.&nbsp;<br><br>One simple solution is a to-do list. This can be online or paper form or white board. Write out everything that needs to be accomplished and assign certain tasks to individuals. Cross off the task when it&nbsp;is completed.&nbsp;<br><br>You can measure the progress by either when the task was accomplished, or the percentage of the whole project that is complete.&nbsp;You could also use a computer software program to track all projects. PayProMedia uses Basecamp, which has an online to-do list, file sharing, message boards, time tracking, project overviews, and commenting options. Many other similar software programs exist, such as Springloops&nbsp;or Microsoft Project.<br><br>Another way to track projects is to have weekly meetings. Each person keeps track of what they accomplished and then compare the progress of the group against the project as a whole.<br><br>No matter which method you choose, it is important to set smaller goals within the overall goal.

Because of this, a lot of pressure is put on companies, and individuals, to blog frequently. This pressure and poor time management typically causes blog posts to be rushed, inadequate, and uninteresting. This turns customers away.&nbsp;<br><br>There are many benefits to blogging, but unless you really enjoy writing and editing, it can be time consuming and frustrating. What companies tend to not anticipate is the amount of time and effort required to get a blog going and to maintain the pace. Here are six tips to help make blogging easier for you and your company.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Plan it out. </strong>Many companies set a schedule of topics and when to post a blog a month or more in advance. This helps give a better overview of topics, while coordinating with holidays or special events that are specific to the company, and giving time to brainstorm and write new content. This also gives room to be flexible should unexpected extenuating circumstances arise. A schedule of topics removes the nagging panic of trying to figure out what you''ll write about next.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Write what you know. </strong>Creating content is easiest when you know the topic you''re writing about. This can be done through different styles and angles that will keep your content fresh and yet still attract readers and educate potential customers about your business. It''s an interesting balancing act, but very possible.

For example, a blog written by a university will have a different tone and style than a marketing agency. Of course make sure to use proper punctuation, grammar, run spell check, and do a proofread before posting, but it''s understood that each business (and each person) has a unique personality. Let yours show through your content.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Make it a habit.</strong> Writing is similar to learning a musical instrument. Your skills improve the more you practice. Professional musicians often say that if they don''t practice one day, they notice it, but if they don''t practice for two days, audiences know it. The same can be for writing. If you set aside specific time to write your blog posts and make it a habit, your productivity will increase because you have a process.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Keep it short. </strong>Typically, blogs range between 200 to 500 words. It may take some testing, but within that word count limit, determine what works best for your company''s style.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Keep the pace.</strong> What works best for your business and customers? Twice a day? Once a day? Once a day but none on weekends? Monday, Wednesday, and Friday? Again, this may take some testing to identify the appropriate balance. Make sure that your blog is supporting and expanding your business, not distracting from it. Whatever the pace is, stick to it.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Recruit help. </strong>Even if you write a brief "tip for the day" or "thought for the day" kind of blogs, eventually a couple paragraphs will feel as daunting as a doctoral dissertation. To give yourself (or your writing/social media team) a breather from time to time, have your other employees write one or two blogs a month. Or, approach other experts in the industry to write a guest blog.<br><br>Think of your blog as a local hangout.

If you have to leave a voicemail, be sure to try again at a later time so you can actually converse with them.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Provide excellent customer service.

They launched a charity called 1 Million Shirts with the idea to donate shirts to the needy in Africa. Sounds good, right?&nbsp;<br><br>Shortly after launching the campaign, Sadler and White found themselves pinned in the middle of an already heated debate within the aid world--the best and worst ways to give to charity.&nbsp;<br><br>Sadler and White''s campaign held the tagline, "Share the wealth, share your shirts--we''re going to change the world." But aid workers contended that the campaign would only hinder economic development. Many argued providing so may free goods would bankrupt those who were trying to sell them, siting the crash of the textile industry in the 1970s and 80s that came after a boom of second-hand goods was sent to various countries. Aid workers argued that this wasn''t doing any good, saying it wasn''t hard to get shirts in Africa, and many were capable of buying their own clothes. &nbsp;<br><br>The topic was fresh due to recent donations of old and useless items after disasters such as the Asian tsunami in 2004 and the earthquake that devastated Haiti in 2010. Aid workers and bloggers took to social media to smear the campaign, saying they felt the charity was disruptive and unhelpful. Many relief workers held the opinion that the shipping costs for the shirts alone could be put to better use to provide payment for more pressing issues.&nbsp;<br><br>Sadler''s and White''s critics jumped on the fact that they had never previously assisted with international aid relief, nor had they visited Africa. &nbsp;<br><br>In an interview with <em>Time Magazine</em>, Sadler revealed that he and White partnered with HELP International and WaterIsLife.com in hopes of sending a few thousand shirts at a time to orphanages in Uganda and Kenya, who had requested them.

Awkwardness only happens if the task is incomplete."<br><br>When the day ends and everyone goes home, most people prefer to leave work at the office. However when your co-workers go home with you, leaving work seems nearly impossible. Hoskins agreed that working with family does make it harder because "discussions will naturally gravitate toward the happenings of each day and the reality is we spend a large part of our days working." However he did not think this was entirely negative saying, "I would rather have quality discussions about work than no discussion at all."<br><br>Having family to walk alongside the ups and downs of the workday can be beneficial. "Seeing each other everyday, sharing successes and&nbsp;failures, and dreaming of what''s next provides great satisfaction and joy. Outside of my faith nothing is more important to me than my family," Hoskins said.<br><br>It''s not all a walk in the park, however. Working with family members can bring some heavier challenges that may need to be handled with special sensitivity. "The hard truth is some have more business talent than others.

ALT text has been used to enhance image SEO, so it is imperative that your SEO efforts make good use of ALT text.&nbsp;<br><br>Search engine spiders can''t see images the way humans can, so ALT text helps them understand what the picture shows. A&nbsp; common mistake is keyword spamming, which packs as many keywords into the ALT text as possible. Search engines are able to differentiate fluff from real descriptions. ALT text was designed to describe images for search engines, so use it that way.&nbsp;<br><br>According to SEO researcher Jerry West, the major search engines have lowered their consideration of ALT text when determining relevance, due to keyword spamming. Still, it''s very important that your images are appropriately described for search engine spiders.&nbsp;<br><br>Here are three tips for writing ALT text for your images:<br><br></p><ol><li><strong>Describe </strong>the image as specifically as possible. Instead of describing what your company does or what your blog is about, write exactly what is happening in the image. Write for humans, not robots.<br><br></li><li><strong>Diversify</strong> the keywords you use. Search engines understand that repetitive keywords indicate spam, while unique words indicate intelligence.<br><br></li><li><strong>Decrease</strong> the number of words you enter. The longer your ALT text, the slower it will be read by text browsers. Keep ALT text to 15 words or fewer.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><br>In addition to good ALT text descriptions, images should be derived from files with SEO optimized titles.

Print advertising is not:&nbsp;<br><br><strong>1. Miraculous<br></strong>Many companies think print ads are a waste of time and money because there wasn''t a marked increase in sales after one or two ads were placed. However, customers may have simply just not seen your ad. After one or two ads, you''re still an unknown to many customers. Repetition over time cements your product in the minds of potential customers. Very rarely does the lightbulb come on when potential customers see an ad for the first time.&nbsp;<br><br>Instead, consider how you can place ads in the same publication (one that fits your target market and offers a wide audience) long-term. A continued presence communicates to customers that your business is around to stay. Taking a full-page ad or placing your ad in a more prominent location (inside cover page, back page, back cover, etc...) can bring greater notice, but is more expensive. Brainstorm with your sales team how your ad copy can create urgency.<br><br>Read these articles for tips on <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/378" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/378"><em>developing an attractive ad</em></a>, and <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/318" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/318"><em>basic graphic design terminology</em>.<br><br></a><strong>2. One and Done<br></strong>It does take a long term commitment. Budget for it, just like you do for the rest of your business. Your local media might be able to help you put together some sort of a program. Newspapers and magazines will work with your budget, especially if they know you are willing to work on a six-time print schedule. They may try to bundle your print ad with a free listing, a discount on online ad placement, or a discount should you place more ads.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>3. A Book<br></strong>Because you only have so much space to educate readers about your company as well as try to meet a need of potential customers, the temptation is to cram as many details as the space will allow. This makes the ad look cluttered, scattered, and overwhelming.&nbsp;<br><br>Instead, think simple. Think obvious. Think billboard style. Ask "what is the one message I want to communicate in this ad?" Don''t make your potential customers work to understand your point. You can change the focus from ad to ad, depending on what you''re trying to sell at that time.

A Luxury<br></strong>The advertising budget can be the first thing to be cut when a company experiences financial issues. See it as a necessity, or you will become less noticeable. If you are experiencing financial difficulty, discuss with your sales team how you can cut back, but do so without losing visibility.

Businesses that perform A/B testing gain competitive advantage and valuable feedback directly from their customers.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>A/B testing involves comparing two variables to identify which one brings in the best response. The aspect being tested is called the "control," and the element being changed is called "treatment." A/B testing allows you to change small aspects of your landing pages, website, CTAs, or other marketing tools one at a time to solidify the best possible marketing effort. For example, A/B testing can be used to identify which size font or background color of a specific page makes the most impact on lead generation. So, if you were testing the effectiveness of a CTA on your website, have your originally designed CTA (the control), then the same CTA with a slight change (treatment), such as the color of it''s background. Something small like this example could lead to more clicks and leads.</p><p><br></p><p>A/B testing can also be used to test an element as a whole. For example, you can design an entirely new CTA or graphic and compare the success rates of the newer version to the original, or control. Whether you test small details or an entire element, be sure to test them at the same time. This allows for the most credible data to be collected. Also keep your original control handy throughout the process to track what changes were successful.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Results of the A/B testing show effects on <a data-cke-saved-href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/276" href="http://mbp.paypromedia.com/academy/entry/276"><em>click-through-rates (CTRs)</em></a>, leads, conversions, and sales.

As a part of great customer service, thanking your customers helps bring them back. It builds relationships, trust, respect, appreciation. It shows the customer how important they are to your business--all things to keep business going.</p><p><br></p><p>Here are a few tips to getting the most out of your thank you''s.</p><p><br></p><ol><li>Keep it personal. Avoid sending a generic email. Taking five minutes to compose a handwritten note goes a long way in keeping customers. Include personal touches, like a congratulations, an anniversary recognition, or best wishes to let the customer know you care for them beyond the business relationship. This in turn helps establish loyalty.</li><li>Be authentic. A customer knows when a "thank you" is phony.&nbsp;</li><li>Stay specific. Don''t send generic letters as a thank you. Specifically state what it is you are thanking the customer for, whether it''s their business over the years, a certain purchase, or a referral. This will hold more meaning.&nbsp;</li><li>Don''t have an agenda. Say "thank you" and leave it as that. Don''t offer any sales or a business pitch. Just show your gratitude.&nbsp;</li><li>Be timely. Don''t delay in sending a thank you to your customers. Send them out no later than one week from the time of referral or transaction.</li><li>Stand out. Often, customers receive numerous tokens of appreciation from vendors throughout the year. Be unique by showing your brand personality so they will remember your business.</li><li>Thank the complainers. Those who complain can offer insight to areas of your business that may need improvement. Don''t forget to thank them for their feedback, even if it''s challenging. Let them know their concerns matter and they are valuable to your business. If you address the issue, chances are, the complainers will want to do business with you.</li><li>Don''t forget your employees. Saying thank you to your employees for what they do will encourage them to do the same to co-workers and customers alike. This will also help them feel valued and recognized.</li><li>Use social media. Another way to say thank you is to highlight a particular customer via social media. This also allows others to take note of them and may lead to networking and referrals for everyone.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Ultimately, the goal of saying thank you is to propel your relationship with your customer. By making them feel appreciated, they will spread the word, generating more business for you.
