*** WooCommerce Subscriptions Changelog ***

2014.01.29 - version 1.4.7
 * Fix: Fatal error "Call to undefined function woocommerce_round_tax_total()" when saving an order on the Edit Order screen with no value set for recurring tax and recurring shipping tax

2014.01.21 - version 1.4.6
 * Tweak: Full WooCommerce 2.1 compatibillity
 * Tweak: If a subcriber visits a variable subscription's page, and that subscription is limited to one per customer, and the customer has an active subscription, automatically initiate the switch process.
 * Tweak: Display subscription's address not default address when changing a single subscription's address (requires on WooCommerce 2.1)
 * Tweak: Add new 'woocommerce_subscriptions_pre_update_recurring_payment_method' hook
 * Fix: When customer is changing payment method, cancel subscription with PayPal only after the customer has completed the sign-up (not when initiating the payment method change)
 * Fix: Display sale price field on the Edit Product screen for both variable products & variable subscription products when Stock Management is disabled (was previously hidden erroneously)
 * Fix: Variable subscription "From:" price when a variation has the same initial price, made up of of a free trial and sign-up fee, but a different recurring price on the same billing period.

 * Fix: don't expire a subscription when the recurring payment method has been changed from one PayPal account to another PayPal account
 * Fix: make sure when changing the payment method on a subscription that all payment gateways have been initialised before attempting to cancel the subscription with the current payment gateway (to make sure the subscription is correctly cancelled)
 * Fix: don't include Subscription Information in new order email unless that admin option is checked (it is off by default)
 * Fix: make sure recurring discounts applied before tax are correctly applied to manual renewals and manul renewal of a failed automatic payment
 * Fix: Add PayPal IPN transaction ID check for those transactions which have an 'txn_id' field to further try and prevent duplicate IPN handling

It is incorrectly documented and leads to assorted bugs when appearing at unexpected times, like immediately for subscriptions of only one payment, at the same time as the last payment and when a subscription is cancelled due to failed payments. Subscriptions internal scheduleding is now used exclusively for expiring a subscription and it's failed payment handling is used whenever a subscription payment fails.

2013.12.13 - version 1.4.5

 * New: The payment method used for automatic recurring payments can now be changed by subscribers: http://docs.woothemes.com/document/subscriptions/customers-view/#section-5
 * New: Database structure for subscriptions to improve performance on all sites and fix memory exhaustion issues on sites with tens of thousands of subscriptions. Subscription meta data is now stored in order meta not user meta.
 * New: The recurring shipping method, title, tax and total used for renewals can now be changed by store managers from the 'Edit Order' page of the original order used to purchase the subscription (for those payment gateways which support changing recurring amounts).
